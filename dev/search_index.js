First it was recognized that both quantities have the same dimensions (no dimensions in this case) and therefore can be added. Since the units are different (degrees and no units) they both need to be converted to the base unit (1), which in the case of the angle means converting it to radians. Finally they can be added.","category":"page"},{"location":"motivation/","page":"Angle as a dimension?","title":"Angle as a dimension?","text":"Since angle is not a dimension we cannot differentiate between units of angle and other dimensionless units, which also leads to problems like this:","category":"page"},{"location":"motivation/","page":"Angle as a dimension?","title":"Angle as a dimension?","text":"julia> using Unitful\n\njulia> 1u\"¬∞\" + 1u\"rad\"\n1.0174532925199433","category":"page"},{"location":"motivation/","page":"Angle as a dimension?","title":"Angle as a dimension?","text":"where the results has no units (converted to units of 1).","category":"page"},{"location":"motivation/#Example-Angular-Frequency","page":"Angle as a dimension?","title":"Example - Angular Frequency","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"motivation/","page":"Angle as a dimension?","title":"Angle as a dimension?","text":"Angular frequency is a common way to describe the frequency of a periodic response. It is a measure of rotational rate (i.e. of the phase angle of the periodic waveform) and has units of (phase) angle over units of time (e.g. rads = 1s). The frequency on the other hand is defined as one over the period and has units of 1 over time (e.g. Hz = 1s). These are essentially the same units for two physically different quantities. And although they are physically different quantities they are used in practice to describe the same thing: how fast is the response repeating (which can also be described with yet a third physically distinct quantity: the period in units of time). The fact that frequency and angular frequency have the same units and are used to describe the same thing is often the source of many embarrassing mistakes.","category":"page"},{"location":"motivation/","page":"Angle as a dimension?","title":"Angle as a dimension?","text":"The SI Brochure states:","category":"page"},{"location":"motivation/","page":"Angle as a dimension?","title":"Angle as a dimension?","text":"The  SI  unit  of  frequency  is  hertz,  the  SI  unit  of  angular  velocity  and  angular  frequency  is  radian  per  second,   and  the  SI  unit  of  activity  is  becquerel,  implying  counts  per  second.
